# vibe-context.io - Development Diary

# 2025-01-06

## Observations

**Database Package Organization: Utility Files Restructure**

Reorganized the `@repo/db` package structure by moving all utility files into a dedicated `utils` folder for better organization:

**Files Moved to `src/utils/`:**

- `test-connection.ts` - Database connectivity testing utility
- `apply-manual-migration.ts` - Manual schema migration application script
- `manual-migration.sql` - SQL statements for manual schema changes
- `apply-rls.ts` - Row Level Security policy application script
- `rls-policies.sql` - Complete RLS policy definitions

**Updated Package Scripts:**

- `db:test` â†’ `tsx src/utils/test-connection.ts`
- `db:manual-migrate` â†’ `tsx src/utils/apply-manual-migration.ts`
- `db:apply-rls` â†’ `tsx src/utils/apply-rls.ts`
- `db:rls` message updated to reference `src/utils/rls-policies.sql`

**Import Path Updates:**

- Updated `test-connection.ts` imports to use relative paths (`../client`, `../schema`)
- Other utility files use `__dirname` for local file references, so they continue to work correctly

**Final Package Structure:**

```
packages/db/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ client.ts           # Database connection client
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts           # Package exports
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/        # Drizzle migration files
â”œâ”€â”€ schema/           # Database table schemas
â””â”€â”€ utils/            # Utility scripts and SQL files
    â”œâ”€â”€ apply-manual-migration.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ apply-rls.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ manual-migration.sql
    â”œâ”€â”€ rls-policies.sql
    â””â”€â”€ test-connection.ts
```

This reorganization improves package maintainability by clearly separating utility scripts from core package functionality, making it easier for developers to locate and manage database administration tools.

**Database Schema Enhancements: Prompt Tags, Document Management, and Security Improvements**

Successfully implemented four critical database schema enhancements to improve prompt management, document organization, and security:

**1. Prompt Tags System Implementation:**

- Added `tags` column to `prompts` table as `text[]` array type
- Enables categorization of prompts with multiple tags (e.g., `['Frontend', 'Authorization', 'Security', 'Supabase Auth']`)
- Supports better prompt discovery and organization for users
- Default value set to empty array `[]` with NOT NULL constraint

**2. Document Management System:**

Created comprehensive document management structure with bidirectional relationship:

- **New `docs` table** with foreign key `projectId` linking to projects
- **Added `docsId` field** to projects table for reverse relationship
- **Document filename fields** for complete project documentation:
  - `techRequirementsFilename` - Technical requirements document
  - `prodRequirementsFilename` - Product requirements document
  - `techStackFilename` - Technology stack documentation
  - `prdFilename` - Product Requirements Document
  - `qaFilename` - Quality assurance documentation
  - `cursorRulesFilename` - Cursor IDE rules configuration

**3. Prompt Security Policy Updates:**

- **Removed DELETE permission** for prompts table to preserve reusability
- Users can no longer delete prompts, ensuring prompt library integrity
- **Clarified update behavior**: System creates new prompt entries on edits rather than modifying existing ones
- This maintains prompt version history and supports reusability across projects

**4. Enhanced RLS Policies:**

Updated Row Level Security policies to include the new `docs` table:

```sql
-- Docs table policies - Users can only access docs for projects they own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view docs for own projects" ON docs
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects
      WHERE projects.docs_id = docs.id
      AND projects.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Technical Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Enhanced prompts schema with tags
export const prompts = pgTable('prompts', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  title: text('title'),
  prompt_markdown_filename: text('prompt_markdown_filename').notNull(),
  tags: text('tags').array().default([]).notNull(), // New tags field
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at', { withTimezone: true })
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at', { withTimezone: true })
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull(),
})

// New docs table for document management
export const docs = pgTable('docs', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  projectId: uuid('project_id')
    .notNull()
    .references(() => projects.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
  techRequirementsFilename: text('tech_requirements_filename'),
  prodRequirementsFilename: text('prod_requirements_filename'),
  techStackFilename: text('tech_stack_filename'),
  prdFilename: text('prd_filename'),
  qaFilename: text('qa_filename'),
  cursorRulesFilename: text('cursor_rules_filename'),
  // ... timestamps
})
```

**Migration Process:**

- Generated Drizzle migration: `20250603033927_thankful_onslaught.sql`
- Applied schema changes using direct SQL execution due to Drizzle Kit compatibility issues
- Successfully verified all tables and columns exist with proper data types:
  - âœ… `projects.docs_id` (uuid)
  - âœ… `prompts.tags` (ARRAY)
  - âœ… `docs` table with all 10 columns and foreign key constraint

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/db/src/schema/prompts.ts` - Added tags array field
- `packages/db/src/schema/docs.ts` - Created new docs table schema
- `packages/db/src/schema/projects.ts` - Added docsId foreign key field
- `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts` - Exported docs table
- `packages/db/src/rls-policies.sql` - Updated security policies
- `packages/db/src/test-connection.ts` - Added docs table verification

**Database Verification:**

All requested changes successfully applied and verified:

- âœ… Projects table: 9 columns including new `docs_id` field
- âœ… Prompts table: 6 columns including new `tags` array field
- âœ… Docs table: 10 columns with proper foreign key relationships
- âœ… All tables accessible and ready for application use

This enhancement provides a solid foundation for advanced prompt management with tagging, comprehensive document organization per project, and improved security through controlled prompt lifecycle management.

**Successfully Integrated Supabase Database with Drizzle ORM**

Completed the setup of the core database infrastructure for vibe-context.io, establishing the foundation for all data persistence and user-specific access control:

**Database Package Architecture:**

1. **Monorepo Package Structure**:

   - Created `@repo/db` package in `packages/db/` directory
   - Followed monorepo conventions with proper TypeScript exports
   - Configured as workspace dependency for the web application

2. **Drizzle ORM Integration**:

   - Installed Drizzle ORM v0.36.4 with PostgreSQL support
   - Configured `drizzle.config.ts` for Supabase PostgreSQL connection
   - Set up migration system using `drizzle-kit` v0.31.1

3. **Database Schema Implementation**:
   - **`projects` table**: Stores user projects with app idea summaries, chat transcripts, and PRD file references
   - **`prompts` table**: Stores reusable prompt content as Markdown files in Supabase Storage
   - **`prompt_nodes` table**: Manages hierarchical prompt tree structure with foreign key relationships

**Technical Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Core schema structure
export const projects = pgTable('projects', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  userId: uuid('user_id').notNull(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  appIdeaSummary_text: text('app_idea_summary_text'),
  chatTranscriptFilename: text('chat_transcript_filename'),
  prdFilename: text('prd_filename'),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at', { withTimezone: true })
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at', { withTimezone: true })
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull(),
})
```

4. **Database Connection Management**:

   - Configured PostgreSQL connection pooling for Supabase
   - Set up environment variable management for secure database access
   - Implemented proper error handling and connection validation

5. **Generated Migration Files**:
   - Successfully created initial migration: `20250603030627_bitter_norrin_radd.sql`
   - Tables created with proper UUID primary keys, foreign key constraints, and timestamp fields
   - Verified all tables exist and are accessible through Drizzle client

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Design:**

Created comprehensive RLS policies for user data isolation:

- **Projects**: Users can only access their own projects (`auth.uid() = user_id`)
- **Prompts**: Authenticated users can manage prompts (shared resource model for MVP)
- **Prompt Nodes**: Users can only access nodes for projects they own (verified through join)

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `packages/db/package.json` - Database package configuration
- `packages/db/src/schema/` - Table schema definitions
- `packages/db/src/client.ts` - Database connection and Drizzle client
- `packages/db/src/rls-policies.sql` - Row Level Security policies
- `packages/db/drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit configuration
- `apps/web/package.json` - Added @repo/db workspace dependency

**Database Verification:**

Successfully tested database connectivity and table accessibility:

- âœ… Projects table exists and is accessible
- âœ… Prompts table exists and is accessible
- âœ… Prompt nodes table exists and is accessible
- ðŸŽ‰ All tables are ready for application use

This completes the foundational database layer required for implementing project management, AI chat functionality, PRD generation, and prompt tree features.

## Problems

**Drizzle Kit Migration Issues:**

1. **Migration Command Failures**: Initial attempts to apply migrations using `drizzle-kit migrate` failed due to existing table conflicts
2. **Push Command Compatibility**: `drizzle-kit push` encountered internal errors with check constraint parsing
3. **Supabase RPC Limitations**: The `exec_sql` RPC function approach for applying migrations was not available in Supabase

**Circular Dependency Challenge:**

- Initial implementation created circular dependency between `projects` and `docs` tables due to bidirectional foreign key references
- TypeScript compilation errors prevented proper schema generation

## Solutions

**Direct SQL Execution Approach:**

- Created `apply-direct-sql.ts` script to execute SQL changes directly using the postgres client
- Bypassed Drizzle Kit migration issues by applying schema changes through the established database connection
- Successfully applied all four requested changes:
  1. Added `tags` column to prompts table
  2. Added `docs_id` column to projects table
  3. Created complete `docs` table with all filename fields
  4. Added proper foreign key constraints

**Circular Dependency Resolution:**

- Removed explicit foreign key reference from projects to docs in schema definition
- Used simple `uuid` type for `docsId` field in projects table
- Maintained foreign key constraint through SQL but avoided TypeScript circular import issues

**Schema Verification Process:**

- Created `check-schema.ts` utility to verify database schema changes
- Confirmed all columns exist with correct data types
- Validated table accessibility through test connection script

**Migration File Management:**

- Generated proper Drizzle migration file: `20250603033927_thankful_onslaught.sql`
- Maintained migration history for future reference
- Applied changes through alternative execution method while preserving migration tracking

This approach successfully delivered all requested database enhancements while working around Drizzle Kit limitations and ensuring robust schema validation.

**Enhanced OAuth Authentication UX: Added Loading States to Sign-in Buttons**

Improved user experience on the login page by adding responsive loading states to OAuth authentication buttons:

**User Experience Improvements:**

1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**:

   - Added individual loading states for Google and GitHub OAuth buttons
   - Users get instant feedback when clicking authentication buttons
   - Eliminates uncertainty about whether the click was registered

2. **Clear Loading Indicators**:

   - Replaced provider icons with animated spinner during authentication
   - Dynamic button text changes to "Signing in with Google..." / "Signing in with GitHub..."
   - Used semantic `Loader2` component from Lucide React for consistency

3. **Smart Button State Management**:
   - Both buttons disabled when any OAuth process is active
   - Prevents accidental multiple authentication attempts
   - Loading state properly reset on authentication errors
   - Successful authentications redirect users before state reset needed

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// Individual loading states for each provider
const [googleLoading, setGoogleLoading] = useState(false)
const [githubLoading, setGithubLoading] = useState(false)

// Loading state activated immediately on button click
const handleGoogleSignIn = async () => {
  try {
    setGoogleLoading(true)
    // ... OAuth logic
  } catch (err) {
    setGoogleLoading(false) // Reset only on error
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added loading states and visual feedback

This enhancement makes the authentication flow feel significantly more responsive and professional, addressing a common UX pain point where users are unsure if their authentication request is processing.

**Critical Memory Leak Fix: Supabase Auth Listener Cleanup**

Fixed a potential memory leak in the `AuthClient` class where Supabase auth state change listeners were not being properly cleaned up:

**The Issue:**

- `AuthClient.destroy()` method only cleared local listeners but didn't unsubscribe from Supabase auth state changes
- This could cause memory leaks in applications where auth clients are frequently created and destroyed
- Especially problematic in React apps with hot reloading or component remounting

**Fix Implemented:**

1. **Added subscription tracking**: Added `authSubscription` property to store the Supabase auth listener subscription
2. **Stored subscription reference**: Modified `init()` method to store the subscription returned by `onAuthStateChange`
3. **Proper cleanup**: Enhanced `destroy()` method to unsubscribe from Supabase listener

**Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Added property to track subscription
private authSubscription?: { data: { subscription: any } }

// Store subscription when setting up listener
this.authSubscription = this.supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(...)

// Proper cleanup in destroy method
public destroy(): void {
  this.listeners.clear()
  if (this.authSubscription) {
    this.authSubscription.data.subscription.unsubscribe()
  }
}
```

This fix ensures that all auth listeners are properly cleaned up, preventing memory leaks and improving application performance, especially in development environments with hot reloading.

**Critical Security Fix: Open Redirect Vulnerability Protection**

Identified and fixed a critical security vulnerability in the OAuth authentication flow that could have been exploited for phishing attacks:

**The Vulnerability:**

- OAuth callback route (`/auth/callback`) was using the `next` parameter directly from URL without validation
- This created an open redirect vulnerability where attackers could redirect users to malicious external sites after authentication
- Error messages in production were exposing detailed technical information

**Security Fixes Implemented:**

1. **URL Validation Function**:

   - Created `validateRedirectUrl()` function that validates all redirect URLs
   - Only allows same-origin redirects by checking URL origin
   - Safely handles malformed URLs with try-catch blocks
   - Returns sanitized pathname + search parameters for valid URLs

2. **Production Error Message Protection**:

   - Added environment-based error message handling
   - Development: Shows detailed error messages for debugging
   - Production: Shows generic "Authentication failed" messages to prevent information disclosure

3. **Enhanced OAuth Flow Security**:
   - Updated login page to safely validate `redirectTo` parameter
   - Implements same URL validation logic on client-side
   - Securely passes redirect destination through OAuth callback URL
   - Maintains intended post-login redirect functionality while preventing abuse

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Core security fixes
- `apps/web/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Safe redirect parameter handling

This fix prevents attackers from crafting malicious authentication URLs that could redirect users to phishing sites after successful login, significantly improving the security posture of the authentication system.

**Updated Supabase Dependencies and Added Security Auditing**

Successfully updated the `@repo/auth` package with the latest Supabase dependencies and improved security posture:

1. **Supabase Core Library Update**:

   - Updated `@supabase/supabase-js` from `^2.39.3` to `^2.49.8`
   - This includes all interim fixes and improvements over ~10 minor versions

2. **Added Missing SSR Dependency**:

   - Added `@supabase/ssr` version `^0.6.1` to dependencies
   - This dependency was being imported in the server.ts file but wasn't declared in package.json
   - Essential for proper server-side rendering authentication functionality

3. **Security Auditing Infrastructure**:

   - Generated `package-lock.json` file in the auth package
   - Enables proper npm audit functionality for vulnerability detection
   - Ran security audit at moderate level - confirmed 0 vulnerabilities found

4. **Monorepo Synchronization**:
   - Updated all workspace dependencies to ensure consistency
   - Verified no breaking changes or new security issues introduced

These updates ensure the authentication system has the latest security patches and bug fixes while enabling ongoing vulnerability monitoring through npm audit.

- Initialized project documentation based on user request.
- Created `project.mdc` outlining the overall vibe-context.io application, its purpose, and high-level features based on the AI-powered app development assistant concept.
- Created `tech-requirements.mdc` detailing functional and non-functional requirements for the MVP. This includes:
  - User authentication via OAuth2 (Supabase Auth).
  - Project creation initiated by an AI chat to formulate the app idea, with outputs (summary, transcript, PRD) stored as files referenced in the Supabase database (`projects` table).
  - PRD generation from the AI-formulated app idea.
  - Hierarchical prompt tree generation and management (CRUD operations on nodes).
  - Automatic downstream prompt regeneration upon parent node edits.
  - Core technologies specified: Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage), Drizzle ORM.
- Created `tech-stack.mdc` recommending and justifying the technology choices (Next.js, TypeScript, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Drizzle) and outlining the initial database model for `projects` and `prompt_nodes` tables, including considerations for Supabase Storage.
- Created `Tasktracker.md` with an initial list of development tasks derived from the requirements documents, categorized and prioritized.
- The core concept revolves around an AI assistant that helps users first formulate an app idea through a chat, then generates a PRD and a tree of prompt-driven development tasks. These artifacts are stored as files, and the system allows for iterative refinement.

## Problems

- No specific problems encountered during the initial documentation phase. The main challenge was synthesizing the various requirements and project descriptions into structured documents.

## Solutions

- Systematically went through the user's requests and existing project context to extract key information for each document.
- Used the provided templates and examples to structure the `.mdc` files and `Tasktracker.md`.
- Iteratively refined the functional requirements to ensure clarity on how features like AI chat for idea generation, file-based storage of artifacts, and prompt tree management would work together.

Successfully resolved the "Missing Supabase environment variables" error and got the authentication system fully working:

1. **Environment Variables Issue**: The error was caused by the `.env.local` file being located at the project root instead of in the Next.js app directory (`apps/web/`)
2. **Next.js Configuration**: Discovered that the Next.js config had static export enabled (`output: 'export'`) which conflicts with server-side authentication routes
3. **Build Errors**: Fixed multiple build errors related to:
   - Static export incompatibility with dynamic authentication routes
   - Missing auth error page (`/auth/error`)
   - `useSearchParams()` requiring Suspense boundaries in Next.js 15
4. **Authentication System**: Confirmed the complete authentication system is working properly with:
   - Supabase client and server configurations
   - OAuth authentication flows (Google, GitHub)
   - Route protection middleware
   - User authentication state management
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

The application is now successfully running on `http://localhost:3000` with full authentication functionality.

## Problems

1. **Environment Variables Location**: `.env.local` was at project root but Next.js looks for it in the app directory
2. **Static Export Conflict**: Next.js config had `output: 'export'` which prevents server-side authentication
3. **Missing Pages**: Auth error page was referenced but didn't exist
4. **Suspense Boundaries**: Next.js 15 requires `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
5. **Build Cache**: Stale build cache was causing persistent errors

## Solutions

1. **Fixed Environment Variables**: Copied `.env.local` from project root to `apps/web/.env.local` where Next.js can find it
2. **Removed Static Export**: Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js` since authentication requires server-side functionality
3. **Created Missing Pages**: Created `/auth/error` page with proper error handling and user feedback
4. **Added Suspense Boundaries**: Wrapped `useSearchParams()` usage in both login and error pages with Suspense components
5. **Clean Build**: Removed `.next` directory and performed fresh build to clear cache

The authentication system is now fully functional and the application builds and runs without errors.

# 2025-06-01

## Observations

- Codebase analysis performed based on current file structure.
- Confirmed completion of initial Next.js project setup with TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, Turbo, ESLint, and Prettier configuration.
- Confirmed definition of basic project structure within `apps/web/src` (components, lib, app router).
- Verified implementation of basic layout components (`sidebar.tsx`, `dashboard-layout.tsx`, `topbar.tsx`) located in `apps/web/src/components/layout/`.
- Updated `Tasktracker.md` to reflect these completed items in Section 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure.
- As per user feedback, Supabase project setup, Drizzle ORM integration, and specific logic for User Authentication, Project Management, and AI Idea Generation features have not yet been implemented. Corresponding tasks remain in "To Do" status.
- Discussed future consideration of integrating VibeContext with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This would allow VibeContext to connect with other AI tools like Windsurf or Cursor, enhancing its context-sharing capabilities.
- Researched MCP: It's an open protocol for standardizing how applications provide context to LLMs, acting like a universal connector.
- Added this as a "Future consideration" in `docs/tech-requirements.mdc`.
- Decided to use OpenRouter for accessing multiple LLMs. Researched OpenRouter and its benefits (unified API, model variety, OpenAI compatibility).
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` to reflect OpenRouter as the chosen solution for LLM access.
- Updated `docs/tech-requirements.mdc` to mention OpenRouter in relevant dependency and risk sections.
- Refined database schema for prompt management: Introduced a new `prompts` table to store reusable prompt content. The `prompt_nodes` table will now link to this `prompts` table via a `prompt_id` foreign key, instead of storing `prompt_text` and `code_snippet` directly. This enables prompt reuse.
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` with the new `prompts` table schema and modified `prompt_nodes` schema.
- Updated `docs/tech-requirements.mdc` functional requirements (FR 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.5.1) to align with this new prompt management strategy, including how prompts are created, edited (with a new prompt entry created on edit to preserve shared prompts), and how regeneration logic is affected.
- Further refined database schema and related requirements:
  - Removed `codeSnippet` field from `prompts` table as Markdown in `prompt_markdown_filename` can handle code.
  - Changed `appIdeaSummaryFilename` in `projects` table to `appIdeaSummary_text` (direct text storage).
  - Changed `promptText` in `prompts` table to `prompt_markdown_filename` (link to Markdown file in Supabase Storage).
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` and `docs/tech-requirements.mdc` to reflect these three changes.

## Problems

- No direct access to git commit history, so progress assessment is based on the current snapshot of the codebase.
- Initial difficulty accessing project documentation files, but this was resolved.

## Solutions

- Relied on user feedback and directory/file listings to infer the status of development tasks.
- Updated documentation iteratively based on confirmed information.
- Verified file paths and re-attempted file access, which was successful.
- Updated `tech-requirements.mdc` with the new MCP feature idea.
- Updated `tech-stack.mdc` and `tech-requirements.mdc` to incorporate OpenRouter.
- Updated database schemas in `tech-stack.mdc` and related functional requirements in `tech-requirements.mdc` for the new prompt reuse feature.
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` and `docs/tech-requirements.mdc` again for the `codeSnippet` removal, `appIdeaSummary_text` change, and `prompt_markdown_filename` change.

# 2025-06-01 (Continued)

## Observations

- Acted as a Senior QA Tester to review existing technical documentation (`tech-requirements.mdc`, `tech-stack.mdc`).
- Generated 15 critical QA-style questions focusing on potential ambiguities, missing details, edge cases, and failure points across UI/UX, backend, APIs, permissions, state management, and integrations.
- Stored these questions in a new file: `docs/quality-assurance-questions.md`.

## Problems

- No new problems encountered.

## Solutions

- Created `docs/quality-assurance-questions.md` and populated it with detailed questions for the product and engineering team.

# 2025-06-01 (Continued)

## Observations

- Decided to use Polar.sh for handling payments and subscriptions.
- Researched Polar.sh: It acts as a Merchant of Record, simplifying tax compliance, and offers features for SaaS billing, subscriptions, and entitlements, with Next.js integration.
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` to include Polar.sh in the technology stack.
- Updated `docs/tech-requirements.mdc` by adding:
  - New Functional Requirements (FR 2.6) for subscription tiers, payment processing via Polar.sh, subscription management, and feature entitlements.
  - Updates to Non-Functional Requirements (NFR 3.2 Security) regarding payment data handling.
  - Added Polar.sh as a dependency (DEP 4.3) and updated Node.js ecosystem to DEP 4.5.
  - Added a new risk (RISK 6.7) related to payment integration and compliance.

## Problems

- No new problems encountered.

## Solutions

- Integrated Polar.sh into the project documentation, outlining its role and impact on requirements and stack.

# 2025-06-01 (Continued)

## Observations

- Decided to use LangChain.js (TypeScript version) for LLM interaction orchestration, including prompt chaining, memory management for AI chat, and managing calls to OpenRouter.
- Researched LangChain.js: It provides modules for prompts, chains, agents, memory, and integrates with the broader JavaScript ecosystem. LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) will be beneficial for composing AI workflows.
- Updated `docs/tech-stack.mdc` to include LangChain.js under a new "AI & LLM Orchestration" category.
- Updated `docs/tech-requirements.mdc`:
  - Modified relevant Functional Requirements (FR 2.2.1, FR 2.3, FR 2.4.1, FR 2.5.1) to specify LangChain.js involvement in orchestrating LLM calls.
  - Added LangChain.js as a key dependency (DEP 4.2), renumbering subsequent dependencies.
  - Updated risk assessment (RISK 6.3, RISK 6.5) to include LangChain.js.

## Problems

- No new problems encountered.

## Solutions

- Integrated LangChain.js into the project documentation, clarifying its role in the architecture.

# 2024-12-19

## Observations

Successfully simplified the `@repo/auth` package by removing unnecessary build complexity:

1. **Removed bundling infrastructure**: Eliminated tsup, build scripts, and compiled output
2. **Direct TypeScript exports**: Package now exports TypeScript source files directly via package.json exports
3. **Simplified dependencies**: Removed build tools and kept only essential runtime dependencies
4. **Cleaner structure**: Package is now just source TypeScript code without build artifacts
5. **Maintained functionality**: All authentication features remain functional in the web app

The auth package is now much simpler and more appropriate for an internal monorepo package. No need for compilation/bundling when the consuming applications (web app) can handle TypeScript directly.

## Problems

Initially overcomplicated the internal auth package with unnecessary build tooling and bundling setup that added complexity without benefit.

## Solutions

Simplified the package to be just TypeScript source code:

- Removed tsup.config.ts and build-related package.json scripts
- Updated package.json exports to point directly to .ts files
- Cleaned up dist folder and unnecessary dependencies
- Maintained all functionality while dramatically reducing complexity

This approach is much more suitable for internal monorepo packages where the consuming applications handle compilation.

Implemented comprehensive Supabase user authentication system for the vibe-context.io application. The authentication system includes:

1. **Supabase Client Configuration**: Created both client-side and server-side Supabase configurations with proper cookie handling for SSR
2. **Authentication Context**: Implemented React context for managing authentication state across the application
3. **OAuth Authentication**: Set up OAuth login flow supporting Google and GitHub providers
4. **Authentication Pages**: Created login and error pages with proper error handling and user feedback
5. **User Interface Components**: Built UserMenu component with avatar, user info, and logout functionality
6. **Route Protection**: Implemented middleware for protecting routes and handling authentication redirects
7. **Integration**: Successfully integrated authentication into the existing layout structure

The implementation follows Next.js 15 App Router patterns and uses shadcn/ui components for consistent styling. All authentication flows are properly handled including OAuth callbacks, session management, and error states.

**MAJOR REFACTORING**: Created a reusable `@repo/auth` package that separates authentication concerns from the web application:

1. **Package Structure**: Created `packages/auth` with proper TypeScript configuration and build setup
2. **Core Authentication**: Moved all authentication logic into reusable classes (`AuthClient`, `AuthServer`)
3. **React Integration**: Created React-specific hooks and providers that can be used in any React application
4. **Platform Independence**: The auth package can now be used across web apps, mobile apps, CLI tools, etc.
5. **Clean Separation**: Removed all authentication code from `apps/web` and replaced with clean imports from `@repo/auth`

The auth package exports:

- `@repo/auth` - Core types and utilities
- `@repo/auth/client` - Browser-side authentication
- `@repo/auth/server` - Server-side authentication for SSR/API routes
- `@repo/auth/react` - React hooks and providers

## Problems

1. **Environment Variables**: Cannot directly create .env files due to gitignore restrictions, so created documentation file instead
2. **Component Dependencies**: Had to verify that required shadcn/ui components (Card, Alert, Avatar, etc.) were already installed
3. **Layout Integration**: Needed to carefully integrate AuthProvider into existing layout structure without breaking current functionality
4. **Build Configuration**: Had to fix TypeScript and tsup configuration for the auth package to build correctly
5. **Import Restructuring**: Required updating all authentication-related imports across the web app

## Solutions

1. **Environment Setup**: Created comprehensive README-env.md file documenting all required environment variables with clear setup instructions
2. **Component Verification**: Verified all required shadcn/ui components exist in the project before implementation

# 2nd June, 2025

## Observations

**Removed Three.js and Replaced with Lightweight CSS Animation**

Successfully removed all Three.js dependencies and components due to excessive bundle size impact. Replaced complex 3D animated bulb with a simple, lightweight CSS-animated lightbulb icon using Lucide React.

**Bundle Size Optimization:**

1. **Three.js Removal**: Eliminated entire Three.js library (~500KB+ minified) from dependencies
2. **Component Simplification**: Replaced complex 3D WebGL rendering with simple SVG icon and CSS animations
3. **Performance Improvement**: Significantly reduced JavaScript bundle size and initial load times

**New Animated Logo Implementation:**

1. **Lucide React Icon**: Used built-in `Lightbulb` icon component for consistency with existing icon system
2. **CSS Animations**: Applied `animate-pulse` for subtle breathing effect and `animate-bounce` on hover
3. **Color Theming**: Used semantic yellow color palette with hover transitions
4. **Responsive Sizing**: Maintained original size prop interface (small/medium/large + pixel values)

**Files Modified:**

- **Deleted**: `apps/web/src/components/shared/animated-bulb.tsx` - Complex Three.js 3D bulb component
- **Deleted**: `apps/web/src/components/shared/animated-bulb-component.tsx` - Alternative Three.js implementation
- **Updated**: `apps/web/src/components/shared/animated-bulb-logo.tsx` - Replaced with CSS-animated SVG icon
- **Updated**: `apps/web/package.json` - Removed `three` and `@types/three` dependencies
- **Fixed**: `apps/web/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Fixed interface definitions for proper TypeScript compilation

**Performance Impact:**

- **Bundle Size Reduction**: Estimated ~500KB+ reduction in production bundle
- **Initial Load Time**: Faster page loads due to smaller JavaScript payloads
- **Runtime Performance**: Eliminated WebGL rendering overhead and complex animation loops
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint by removing 3D scene management

The new implementation maintains the visual branding while dramatically improving performance and maintainability.

## Problems

- Three.js library added significant bundle size overhead (~500KB+) for a simple logo animation
- Complex 3D rendering was overkill for the logo use case
- Multiple ESLint errors with Three.js TypeScript definitions that were difficult to resolve
- WebGL rendering could cause performance issues on lower-end devices

## Solutions

- **Complete Three.js Removal**: Deleted all Three.js components and dependencies
- **CSS-Based Animation**: Replaced with simple, performant CSS animations using Tailwind classes
- **Icon Consistency**: Used Lucide React's `Lightbulb` icon to maintain consistency with existing icon system
- **Interface Fixes**: Resolved sidebar TypeScript interface issues by properly defining Document and Project types
- **Maintained API**: Kept the same component interface (size props) for backward compatibility

The solution provides the same visual branding with dramatically better performance and maintainability.

# 5th June, 2025

## Observations

Modernized ESLint configuration with enterprise-grade rules including type safety enforcement, import cycle detection, and unused imports cleanup. Fixed numerous linting errors across the codebase to improve code quality and consistency.

## Problems

Multiple TypeScript and ESLint errors including unsafe any usage, incorrect type imports, unused variables, and array type inconsistencies. Some complex Three.js and auth callback type issues remain challenging to resolve.

## Solutions

Systematically fixed type import issues by using proper `import type` syntax, prefixed unused variables with underscore, converted array types to `Array<T>` format, and improved type safety in auth components. Applied proper error handling and type guards where possible. Some complex issues with Three.js geometry types and auth callback cookie handling require deeper investigation.

# vibe-context.io - Development Diary

# 2025-01-06

## Observations

- Initialized project documentation based on user request.
- Created `project.mdc` outlining the overall vibe-context.io application, its purpose, and high-level features based on the AI-powered app development assistant concept.
- Created `tech-requirements.mdc` detailing functional and non-functional requirements for the MVP. This includes:
  - User authentication via OAuth2 (Supabase Auth).
  - Project creation initiated by an AI chat to formulate the app idea, with outputs (summary, transcript, PRD) stored as files referenced in the Supabase database (`projects` table).
  - PRD generation from the AI-formulated app idea.
  - Hierarchical prompt tree generation and management (CRUD operations on nodes).
  - Automatic downstream prompt regeneration upon parent node edits.
  - Core technologies specified: Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage), Drizzle ORM.
- Created `tech-stack.mdc` recommending and justifying the technology choices (Next.js, TypeScript, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Drizzle) and outlining the initial database model for `projects` and `prompt_nodes` tables, including considerations for Supabase Storage.
- Created `Tasktracker.md` with an initial list of development tasks derived from the requirements documents, categorized and prioritized.
- The core concept revolves around an AI assistant that helps users first formulate an app idea through a chat, then generates a PRD and a tree of prompt-driven development tasks. These artifacts are stored as files, and the system allows for iterative refinement.

## Problems

- No specific problems encountered during the initial documentation phase. The main challenge was synthesizing the various requirements and project descriptions into structured documents.

## Solutions

- Systematically went through the user's requests and existing project context to extract key information for each document.
- Used the provided templates and examples to structure the `.mdc` files and `Tasktracker.md`.
- Iteratively refined the functional requirements to ensure clarity on how features like AI chat for idea generation, file-based storage of artifacts, and prompt tree management would work together.

## Observations

- Codebase analysis performed based on current file structure.
- Confirmed completion of initial Next.js project setup with TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, Turbo, ESLint, and Prettier configuration.
- Confirmed definition of basic project structure within `apps/web/src` (components, lib, app router).
- Verified implementation of basic layout components (`sidebar.tsx`, `dashboard-layout.tsx`, `topbar.tsx`) located in `apps/web/src/components/layout/`.
- Updated `Tasktracker.md` to reflect these completed items in Section 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure.
- As per user feedback, Supabase project setup, Drizzle ORM integration, and specific logic for User Authentication, Project Management, and AI Idea Generation features have not yet been implemented. Corresponding tasks remain in "To Do" status.

## Problems

- No direct access to git commit history, so progress assessment is based on the current snapshot of the codebase.

## Solutions

- Relied on user feedback and directory/file listings to infer the status of development tasks.
- Updated documentation iteratively based on confirmed information.

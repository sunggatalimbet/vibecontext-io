# vibe-context.io - Development Diary

# 1st June, 2025

## Observations

- Initialized project documentation based on user requirements
- Created core project documents: `project.mdc`, `tech-requirements.mdc`, `tech-stack.mdc`, and `Tasktracker.md`
- Established technology stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Drizzle ORM
- Defined MVP features: OAuth authentication, AI-driven project management, prompt tree system

## Problems

- No specific technical problems during initial documentation phase
- Main challenge was synthesizing various requirements into structured documents

## Solutions

- Systematically extracted key information from user requests and project context
- Used provided templates to structure documentation files
- Iteratively refined functional requirements for clarity

# 1st June, 2025 (Continued)

## Observations

- Completed initial Next.js project setup with TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, and Turbo
- Implemented basic layout components and project structure
- Added MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration consideration for future AI tool connectivity
- Decided to use OpenRouter for unified LLM access across multiple models
- Refined database schema with separate `prompts` table for prompt reusability

## Problems

- No direct access to git commit history for progress assessment
- Initial difficulty accessing project documentation files

## Solutions

- Relied on user feedback and directory/file listings to infer development task status
- Updated documentation iteratively based on confirmed information
- Integrated OpenRouter and MCP concepts into project architecture

# 1st June, 2025 (Continued)

## Observations

- Added QA testing perspective with 15 critical questions for product validation
- Added Polar.sh to documentation as future payment processing solution
- Added LangChain.js to documentation for future LLM orchestration and prompt chaining
- Updated all project documentation to reflect new technology choices

## Problems

- No technical problems encountered during technology stack expansion

## Solutions

- Created comprehensive QA questions document for future testing
- Documented Polar.sh as future payment infrastructure for SaaS billing
- Documented LangChain.js for future sophisticated AI workflow management

# 2nd June, 2025

## Observations

- Simplified `@repo/auth` package by removing unnecessary build complexity
- Eliminated bundling infrastructure and build tools for cleaner monorepo structure
- Package now exports TypeScript source directly for better maintainability

## Problems

- Initially overcomplicated internal auth package with unnecessary bundling setup

## Solutions

- Removed tsup, build scripts, and compiled output
- Updated package.json exports to point directly to TypeScript files
- Maintained all functionality while reducing complexity

# 2nd June, 2024 (Continued)

## Observations

- Implemented comprehensive Supabase authentication system
- Created reusable `@repo/auth` package separating authentication concerns
- Built OAuth login flow with Google and GitHub providers
- Integrated authentication into existing layout with proper error handling

## Problems

- Environment variables location issues (wrong directory)
- Build configuration conflicts with static export settings
- Missing authentication pages and Suspense boundary requirements

## Solutions

- Moved environment files to correct Next.js app directory
- Removed static export configuration for server-side auth compatibility
- Created proper error pages and added required Suspense boundaries
- Successfully modularized authentication into reusable package

# 2nd June, 2025 (Continued)

## Observations

- Enhanced OAuth authentication UX with individual loading states for sign-in buttons
- Fixed critical memory leak in AuthClient by properly cleaning up Supabase listeners
- Resolved open redirect vulnerability in OAuth callback route with URL validation
- Updated Supabase dependencies and added security auditing infrastructure

## Problems

- Users experienced uncertainty during OAuth authentication without visual feedback
- Memory leaks from uncleanup Supabase auth listeners in development
- Security vulnerability allowing external redirects after authentication
- Missing dependencies for server-side rendering functionality

## Solutions

- Added animated loading indicators and disabled button states during authentication
- Implemented proper subscription cleanup in AuthClient destroy method
- Created URL validation function restricting redirects to same-origin only
- Updated @supabase/supabase-js and added @supabase/ssr dependencies

# 2nd June, 2025 (Continued)

## Observations

- Updated documentation formatting standards in `.cursorrules` file
- Established proper date format using ordinals and full month names
- Reorganized diary entries in chronological order (oldest first)
- Implemented security guidelines for documentation

## Problems

- Previous diary entries used inconsistent date formats and reverse chronological order
- Documentation contained verbose entries that could be more concise
- Needed standardized formatting rules across the codebase

## Solutions

- Updated `.cursorrules` with specific diary formatting requirements
- Restructured entire diary with proper chronological order
- Made entries more concise while maintaining essential information
- Established security guidelines to prevent exposure of sensitive data

## VibeContext - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

*Version: 0.1.0*
*Date: 2025-06-01*

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

*   This product aims to solve the problem of unstructured and inefficient initial AI application ideation and prompt engineering by enabling users to collaboratively define app concepts with an AI assistant and then generate a structured, hierarchical tree of development prompts.
*   It will be used by solo AI developers, small AI-focused teams, and technical product managers (or "vibe coders") at the beginning of an AI project lifecycle, when they need to translate a nascent idea into a concrete plan for AI interaction and development.
*   The solution must be intuitive, fast, and iterative, focused on streamlining the journey from a vague app idea to a set of actionable, context-aware development prompts, ultimately accelerating AI application development.

### 1.2 Objectives

*   Deliver an MVP by end of Q2 2025 that allows users to successfully generate an initial app idea summary via AI chat, produce a basic PRD from this summary, and generate a hierarchical prompt tree.
*   Enable users to complete the flow from starting a new project (initiating AI idea chat) to viewing a generated prompt tree in under 5 minutes (excluding AI processing time) for a typical app idea.
*   Ensure that 90% of core user actions (project creation, PRD generation, prompt tree generation, node editing) are completed successfully without unrecoverable errors during the MVP phase.
*   Achieve a user satisfaction score (CSAT) of at least 70% on the core AI idea generation and prompt tree creation flow within the first 3 months post-MVP launch.
*   Establish a secure and reliable system for user authentication (OAuth2 via Supabase Auth) and data persistence (Supabase DB with Drizzle) for all user-generated projects and prompts.

### 1.3 Target Users

*   **Primary:** Solo AI developers and small teams (2-5 members) who are comfortable with AI concepts and prompt engineering but lack dedicated tools to structure their AI-specific development workflow from idea to initial prompts.
*   **Secondary:** Technical Product Managers or "Vibe Coders" who are responsible for defining AI features and interaction flows and need a way to quickly prototype and document these for development teams or for their own AI agent interactions.
*   Users primarily on desktop/laptop environments, requiring a web-based application. Internet connectivity is essential for AI interactions and data synchronization.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Authentication & Account Management

*   **Description:** Allows users to securely sign up and log in to the application using third-party OAuth providers, ensuring their projects and data are private and accessible only to them.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a new user, I want to sign up quickly using my existing Google or GitHub account so that I don't have to create and remember another password.
    *   As a returning user, I want to log in easily using my chosen OAuth provider so that I can access my projects.
    -   As an authenticated user, I want to be able to log out securely so that my session is ended.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can initiate sign-up/login via UI buttons for Google and GitHub (or other configured OAuth providers).
    *   Successful OAuth authentication creates a user record in Supabase Auth and establishes a user session.
    *   Users are redirected to their dashboard/project area upon successful login.
    *   Clear error messages are displayed for authentication failures (e.g., provider error, access denied).
    *   A logout option is available and successfully invalidates the user session, redirecting to a public page.
    *   User data is protected using Supabase Row Level Security.

### 2.2 AI-Powered App Idea Formulation & Project Creation

*   **Description:** Enables users to collaboratively formulate their application idea through an interactive AI chat. The refined idea and chat transcript are saved as files, and a new project is created to house these and subsequent artifacts.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user with a new app idea, I want to chat with an AI assistant to help me clarify and structure my thoughts so that I have a well-defined concept to start with.
    *   As a user, I want the AI-clarified app idea summary and the chat history to be saved automatically so that I can refer back to them.
    *   As a user, I want to name my project once the initial idea is formulated so that I can easily identify it later.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can initiate a new project, triggering an AI chat interface.
    *   The AI chat guides the user with questions to refine their app idea.
    *   The final AI-generated app idea summary and the full chat transcript are saved as uniquely named files (e.g., to Supabase Storage).
    *   A new project record is created in the Supabase `projects` table, storing the project name and filenames for the app idea summary and chat transcript.
    *   The project is associated with the authenticated user.
    *   Users are redirected to the project workspace where the app idea summary is displayed.

### 2.3 Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generation

*   **Description:** Allows users to generate a basic Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the AI-formulated app idea. The generated PRD is saved as a file and linked to the project.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to generate a PRD from my AI-formulated app idea with one click so that I have a foundational document for AI agent context or further planning.
    *   As a user, I want the generated PRD to be saved with my project so that I can access it later.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A "Generate PRD" option is available in the project workspace.
    *   The content of the `app_idea_summary_filename` associated with the project is used as input for an LLM to generate the PRD.
    *   The generated PRD is saved as a uniquely named file (e.g., to Supabase Storage).
    *   The `projects` table is updated with the filename of the generated PRD.
    *   The content of the generated PRD file is displayed to the user.
    *   Loading states and error handling are implemented for the generation process.

### 2.4 Hierarchical Prompt Tree Generation

*   **Description:** Enables users to generate a hierarchical tree of development prompts based on their app idea (or the generated PRD). This tree provides a structured, task-oriented view for AI-driven development.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to generate a tree of development prompts from my app idea/PRD so that I have a structured plan for interacting with an AI development agent.
    *   As a user, I want the prompt tree to be saved with my project so that I can work on it iteratively.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A "Generate Prompt Tree" option is available.
    *   The app idea/PRD file content is used as input for an LLM to generate the prompt tree structure and initial prompt text for each node.
    *   The generated tree structure (nodes, parent-child relationships, prompt text, optional code snippets, display order) is saved to the `prompt_nodes` table in Supabase, linked to the project.
    *   The UI dynamically renders the hierarchical prompt tree.
    *   Loading states and error handling are implemented.

### 2.5 Prompt Node Management (CRUD)

*   **Description:** Allows users to manually create, read (view), update (edit), and delete nodes within the prompt tree, providing full control over the generated structure.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to add new prompt nodes to the tree (as children or siblings) so that I can expand or reorganize the development tasks.
    *   As a user, I want to edit the text and optional code snippet of any prompt node so that I can refine the instructions for the AI agent.
    *   As a user, I want to delete prompt nodes (and their children) so that I can remove irrelevant or incorrect tasks.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   UI controls allow adding new nodes at specified positions in the tree.
    *   Node content (prompt text, code snippet) is editable inline or via a modal/panel.
    *   Changes to nodes are persisted to the `prompt_nodes` table in Supabase.
    *   Deleting a node also deletes its descendant nodes.
    *   Confirmation is required before deleting nodes.
    *   The UI accurately reflects all CRUD operations on the prompt tree in real-time or with minimal delay.

### 2.6 Downstream Prompt Regeneration

*   **Description:** When a parent prompt node is edited, all its direct and indirect child nodes (downstream prompts) are automatically re-evaluated and regenerated by an LLM to maintain contextual consistency.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, when I edit a parent prompt, I want all its child prompts to automatically update based on my changes so that the entire development plan remains consistent.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   After a parent node's content is updated and saved, a process is triggered to regenerate its descendant nodes.
    *   The context for regenerating each descendant includes the updated path from the root to itself.
    *   Regenerated content for descendant nodes is updated in the `prompt_nodes` table.
    *   The UI dynamically updates to show the new content for the regenerated nodes.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., loading indicators) is provided during regeneration.

## 3. User Experience (UX)

*   **3.1 Interface Paradigm:** The application should feel like an interactive notebook (similar to Jupyter) combined with visual planning (like Whimsical) and collaborative documentation (like Notion), but specifically tailored for AI prompt development.
*   **3.2 Simplicity & Clarity:** Core actions (initiating idea chat, generating PRD, generating/editing prompt tree) must be highly discoverable and intuitive. The user flow from idea to prompt tree should be seamless.
*   **3.3 Visual Style:** A clean, modern, and minimalist aesthetic will be used, leveraging shadcn/ui components for a professional and focused environment. Support for light/dark themes (via next-themes) is expected.
*   **3.4 Responsiveness (Desktop First):** While not mobile-first for MVP, the application must be fully responsive and usable on standard desktop and laptop screen sizes. Key interactions should be optimized for mouse and keyboard.
*   **3.5 Feedback & Error Handling:** The system must provide clear visual feedback for ongoing processes (e.g., AI generation, saving) and communicate errors constructively, allowing users to understand and recover.
*   **3.6 Accessibility:** Adherence to basic WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines for contrast, keyboard navigability of core features, and ARIA attributes for custom components where appropriate.

## 4. Success Metrics

*   **Activation Rate:** Percentage of new users who successfully generate at least one app idea summary and a corresponding prompt tree within their first session.
*   **Core Feature Adoption:** Number of PRDs generated per active user per week; Number of prompt trees generated/edited per active user per week.
*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully complete the full flow from AI idea chat to prompt tree generation without abandoning the process.
*   **User Retention (MVP Focus):** Percentage of users returning to use the application at least once within 7 days of their first use.
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** CSAT/NPS scores collected via in-app surveys focusing on ease of use and value of generated outputs (target NPS > 20 for MVP).
*   **Average Generation Time:** Track average time taken for PRD generation and initial prompt tree generation to identify performance bottlenecks.

---

## 5. Constraints

*   **5.1 Platform Constraints:** MVP is a web-based application targeting modern desktop browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No native mobile app support for MVP.
*   **5.2 Feature Scope (MVP):**
    *   Focus is on the core flow: AI Idea Chat -> Project Creation -> PRD Generation -> Prompt Tree Generation & Basic Editing -> Downstream Regeneration.
    *   Real-time collaboration, advanced PRD customization/templates, direct AI agent execution of prompts, version history for prompts/PRDs, and complex analytics are out of scope for MVP.
*   **5.3 Technology Stack:** Must adhere to the defined tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage), Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, and an external LLM service.
*   **5.4 LLM Dependency:** Core functionality relies heavily on an external LLM provider. Performance, cost, rate limits, and output quality of the LLM are external dependencies and potential constraints.
*   **5.5 Data Storage:** Generated artifacts (idea summaries, chat transcripts, PRDs) are stored as files in Supabase Storage, referenced by filenames in the database. Prompt tree data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL.

## 6. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   Real-time multi-user collaboration on projects and prompt trees.
*   Advanced PRD customization, user-defined templates, and versioning.
*   Integration with code repositories or AI agent execution platforms.
*   Version history and rollback capabilities for individual prompts and entire trees.
*   More sophisticated analytics on prompt effectiveness and generation quality.
*   Ability to import/export projects or specific artifacts in various formats.
*   Team-based features and granular permissions.
*   Enhanced AI chat capabilities for ongoing project refinement beyond initial idea generation.
*   Offline support or local-first capabilities (significant architectural change).

## 7. Open Questions

*   What specific OAuth2 providers (beyond Google/GitHub) should be prioritized for MVP if time/resources are limited?
*   How should the system guide users if the LLM fails to generate a satisfactory PRD or prompt tree? (e.g., retry options, prompt refinement tips).
*   What is the acceptable data retention policy for chat transcripts and generated files in Supabase Storage for MVP?
*   Should there be a limit on the number of projects, generated files, or prompt nodes per user in the MVP (due to storage/cost)?
*   What level of detail is expected in the AI-generated PRD for it to be considered valuable for MVP users?
*   How will users be notified of changes during asynchronous downstream prompt regeneration if it takes significant time?
